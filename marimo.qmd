# Just another Quarto project (on Connect Cloud)

```python {.marimo}
#| echo: true
import marimo as mo
slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 10, 1, label="Look, a slider!")
slider # show the slider
```
## More things

And we can respond!

```python {.marimo}
# No echo here means we do not show the code
mo.md('slider x 2 = ' +  str(2 * slider.value))
```
